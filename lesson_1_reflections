Hello 
I
 just 
learned 
how 
to 
compare 
between
 two 
files 
in 
the 
Mac 
Terminal 
using 
the 
Diff 
editor

2) well future mistakes could be avoided by enabling
Me , the programmer, to check past versions of my code!
It could also pinpoint me where I needed to improve and 
Guides me further to avoid mistakes by pointing them out

3) Manual commits come in handy because the programmer is the person mostly 
Aware when his/her code needs to be saved. Leaving such a judgement to a computer
Is reckless since they're unreliable unless instructed

4) Multi file commits allow for syncorization throughout the whole project

Git clone git log git diff
git config --global color.ui auto == colored git


5)Git log views to us the history of the file and using the diff command we could view the difference made between two commits on the repository 
6) I can always get back to any past commit using my git checkout command
7) I want to use Git to freely explore and experiment  the wilderness of my logical imagination
